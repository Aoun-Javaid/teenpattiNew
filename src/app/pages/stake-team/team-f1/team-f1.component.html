          In January 2024, we announced our biggest move to date: the Stake F1
          Team. We unveiled a brand-new identity for the team to create Formula
          One’s freshest and most exciting team on the Grid. Following a
          successful year with Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake in 2023, that saw
          non-stop action both on and off the track, we have stood by our
          promise not just to take part, but to elevate the game.
