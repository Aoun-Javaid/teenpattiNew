        <h2 class="is-inline !text-[28px]">5 Tips For Effective Management Of Your Gambling Activities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Effective management of your gambling activities can be done by prioritizing other recreational
                activities too</li>
            <li>Before a gambling session, have a in mind of how much you want to spend gambling, and how long you will
                be gambling for</li>
            <li>Do not spend more than what you can to lose</li>
            <li>Understanding the odds and knowing the risks associated with gambling</li>
            <li>Identify when you are no longer having fun or where gambling has become a problem for you, and stop</li>
            <li>Set loss limits, wager limits to assist with managing your gambling activities</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="stake-title !text-[28px]">Knowing the Odds</h1>
        <p class="inline-text">There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about gambling - understanding the odds of
            gambling helps put the chances of
            winning into perspective.</p>
        <p class="inline-text">Stake offers two products, Casino and Sportsbook.</p>
        <p class="inline-text">
            Both products have different win rates and probability that players need to be aware of, which will help to
            understand
            the risks associated with gambling.
        </p>
        <h1 class="second-heading !text-[20px] ">House Advantage/House Edge</h1>
        <p class="inline-text">Games have a house edge to ensure a percentage of the total amount wagered is returned to
            the House, which in this case
            is Stake.
        </p>
        <h1 class="second-heading !text-[20px]">Randomness</h1>
        <p class="inline-text">All gambling has an element of randomness - there is no way to control the outcome of any
            casino game or sporting event.</p>
        <h1 class="second-heading !text-[20px]">Independent Outcomes</h1>
        <p class="inline-text">Games/Spins are not related. Their outcomes are not dependent on how much, or how long,
            youâ€™ve previously played the
            game for.
        </p>

        <h1 class="second-heading !text-[20px]">Odds and Probability</h1>
        <p class="inline-text">Odds and probability are ways to describe your chances of winning. Whilst the odds can
            appear to be low, there are no
            certainties in betting.</p>
        <h2 class="second-heading">Introducing Our Responsible Gambling Tools</h2>
        <p class="inline-text">Gambling should always be a form of entertainment. In order to assist you in keeping your
            gambling activities fun, Stake
            has a range of responsible gambling tools which you are able to make use of at any point in time.</p>
        <p class="inline-text">Play for fun, not for funds.</p>
        <h2 class="second-heading !text-[20px]">Gambling Limits</h2>
        <h1 class="stake-title !text-[16px]">Loss limit</h1>
        <p class="inline-text">A wager limit (or betting limit) allows you to set a limit on how much you can wager over
            your set period of time. The
            maximum bet limit can be set over a period of one day, one week or one month. The limit is not a net limit
            so profits
            are excluded. This means, if you are profitable during the period these profits are not offset against your
            maximum bet
            limit.</p>
        <p class="inline-text">
            To increase or decrease your limits you must remove existing limits and create new limits. Upon removing
            limits a
            24-hour cool off period will commence before you are able to create your new limit.
        </p>
        <h2 class="second-heading !text-[24px]">Self-Exclusion</h2>
        <p class="inline-text">A self-exclusion tool offers the ability to suspend all access to your account should you
            feel that you are at risk of
            developing a gambling problem , or in some cases, believe you currently have one.</p>
        <p class="!text-[18px]">The available periods are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Months</li>
            <li>1 Year</li>
            <li>Indefinite</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-text">
            In the event an indefinite exclusion is set, access to your account(s) will remain blocked until such time
            should you
            actively request to revoke the indefinite exclusion. The indefinite exclusion imposes a minimum exclusion
            period of at
            least 6 months, from the date of application. Once the 6 month period has lapsed, your account can be
            considered for
            reactivation subject to a formal return to play review.
        </p>
        <p class="inline-text">In order to initiate the review process, please contact our support team via email.</p>
        <h2 class="second-heading !text-[20px]">Temporary Exclusion</h2>
        <p class="inline-text">
            Stake also provides alternative options to suspend your account temporary, known as temporary exclusion .
            Whether you
            would like to take a break from gambling to re-evaluate your personal goals, save some money or simply spend
            time on
            other activities, the option is made available to you.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Day</li>
            <li>1 Week</li>
            <li>1 Month</li>
            <li>3 Months</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-text">
            Note: Stake reserves the right to self-exclude a customers account should we determine that gambling may not
            be safe for
            you to continue.
        </p>
        <h2 class="second-heading">Application of Temporary Exclusion or Self-Exclusion</h2>
        <p class="inline-text">1. Upon initial application, your account will enter into a 24 hour cooling off period
        </p>
        <p class="inline-text">2. Once 24 hour cooling off period has lapsed, you will be presented the applicable
            timeframes</p>
        <p class="inline-text">3. In the event no self-exclusion period is selected, your account will reopen
            automatically</p>
        <p class="inline-text">4. No further activity will be permitted once the exclusion has been applied and taken
            effect</p>
        <p class="inline-text">5. It will not be possible to reactivate your account until the chosen time period has
            lapsed</p>
        <p class="inline-text">6. Where a defined self-exclusion is in effect, your account will automatically
            reactivate once the chosen time period
            has lapsed</p>
        <p class="inline-text">7. Where an indefinite self-exclusion is in effect, whether applied by the client or
            operator, a minimum of 6 months
            must pass before the account can be considered for review</p>
        <h2 class="second-heading">Help Organizations</h2>

            their gambling, there are several
            external support agencies that can assist with providing advice.</p>
