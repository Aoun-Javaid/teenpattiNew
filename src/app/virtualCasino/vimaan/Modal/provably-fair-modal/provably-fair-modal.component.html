                Result of each round (Game's "Fly away" multiplier ) is not generated on our servers. It's generated
                with help of round players and is fully transparent. This way, it's impossible for anyone to manipulate
                game output. Also, anyone can check and confirm game fairness

            <p class="text-[#9ea0a3] mt-2.5  text-[14px] font-light">
                Round result is generated from four independent participants of the round: game operator and first 3
                betters of the round. Operator is generating server seed (random 16 symbols). Hashed version of this
                server seed is available publicly before round starts (In user menu, check "Provably Fair Settings" and
                then "Next server seed SHA256") Client seed is generated on the side of each player and when round
                starts first 3 betters are participating in generating round result.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[#9ea0a3] mt-2.5  text-[14px] font-light ">
                When round starts, game merges server seed with three client seeds. From merged symbols is generated
                SHA512 hash, and from this hash - game result.
